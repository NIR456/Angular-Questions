## Angular Decorators
  - Decorators are design patterns used to isolate the modification or decoration of a class without modifying the source code.

  - In AngularJS, decorators are functions that allow a service, directive, or filter to be modified before it is used. 

    **There are four main types of angular decorators:**
     ####  Class decorators, such as @Component and @NgModule
     #### Property decorators for properties inside classes, such as @Input and @Output
     #### Method decorators for methods inside classes, such as @HostListener
     #### Parameter decorators for parameters inside class constructors, such as @Inject
